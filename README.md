Assignment 1

The source files that are being submitted are: dna.h, dna.cpp, and main.cpp. These are all contained within the GitHub 
repository, Assignment_1.

The problems in the code that I ran into was just simple C++ code errors for one reason or another, mainly because my knowledge 
in C++ is minimal at best, or some simple run-time errors based on like segmentation faults and things of that nature. 

The references I used were several websites linked below and Ryan Lidner for some help on the equations while printing the 
random strings.
